# DX12RendererV2
This repository is a fresh start on my other DX12Renderer repository (https://github.com/Contingencyy/DX12Renderer). The reason I decided to start fresh is that I learned and altered my programming style so much in the last couple of months that I would like to have a fresh start with this project, instead of rewriting a very large portion of it. I am also going to be using more of a "Sane C++/C-style C++" code style instead of modern C++ because modern C++ is not really my cup of tea anymore.

At this point I do not really know what this project will grow into, I have many things I want to explore, like DirectX 12 ultimate features (mesh & amplification shaders, enhanced barriers, gpu upload heaps, etc.), render graphs, multithreaded rendering, raytraced shadows and reflections, decal rendering, deferred rendering, and so much more. So whatever I feel like I want to implement next, will be implemented next.
